- when cards are shuffled, there are different animations (either for each player, or random, or different mechanic)
- generally nice animations
- special effects for card (sort of like in balatro)
    should these be constant for a single card (so other player can pick it up in the next round, or just a single round)
- every player should have their own cometics, this should be represented on the game board (individual board style, individual marble style, cards etc)
- play combo cards (meaning multiple cards in a single run)
- players may select their colors (schneller isch de gschwinder, cpu may have aggressive style and they always pick their favourite colors), also have a selection of colors, not only rgbw
